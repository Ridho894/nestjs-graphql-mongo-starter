## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable type prefix:

  - `feat:` when adding a new feature
  - `fix:` when fixing a bug
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `style:` for changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
  - `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - `perf:` for performance improvements
  - `test:` for adding or modifying tests
  - `chore:` for changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
  - `ci:` for changes to CI configuration files and scripts

### Branch Naming Rules

To keep the repository clean and organized, follow these naming rules when creating branches:

- Use lowercase letters and dashes (`-`) to separate words.
- Prefix branches based on their purpose:
  - `feature/` for new features (e.g., `feature/add-user-module`)
  - `fix/` for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/fix-login-error`)
  - `chore/` for maintenance tasks or dependency updates (e.g., `chore/update-packages`)
  - `hotfix/` for urgent fixes on the `main` branch (e.g., `hotfix/security-patch`)
  - `release/` for preparing new releases (if applicable, e.g., `release/1.0.0`)
- Keep branch names short but meaningful.
- Avoid using special characters or spaces.

### JavaScript/TypeScript Styleguide

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use semicolons at the end of statements.
- Use single quotes for strings.
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation.
- Use camelCase for variables, properties, and function names.
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces.
- Prefer the object spread operator over `Object.assign`.
- Prefer arrow functions over anonymous function expressions.
- Avoid using `any` type in TypeScript when possible.

### Documentation Styleguide

- Use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for documentation.
- Reference classes, methods, and variables using backticks: `` `Class.method()` `` or `` `variable` ``.
- Use fenced code blocks with the appropriate language tag.
- Documentation should be clear and concise.
